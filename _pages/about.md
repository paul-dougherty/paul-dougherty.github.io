I am a PhD candidate in the [Program in Ecology](http://www.uwyo.edu/pie/) and the Department of [Zoology & Physiology](http://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/) at the University of Wyoming, where I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Carling](https://carlinglab.com/).

My research aims to improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain biodiversity, particularly in birds. I cite my lifelong love of natural history as the primary motivation for my work.
