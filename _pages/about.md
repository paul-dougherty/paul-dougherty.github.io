I am an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Massachusetts, where I am advised by [Maria Stager](https://stagerlab.weebly.com/) and [Nathan Senner](http://www.sennerlab.com/). I recently completed my PhD with [Matthew Carling](https://carlinglab.com/) in the [Program in Ecology & Evolution](http://www.uwyo.edu/pie/) and the Department of [Zoology & Physiology](http://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/) at the University of Wyoming.

My research aims to improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain biodiversity, particularly in birds. I cite my lifelong love of natural history as the primary motivation for my work.
