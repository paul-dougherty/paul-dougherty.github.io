## Adaptive divergence in molting behavior as mechanism of reproductive isolation in birds

The Great Plains of North America host a suture zone where multiple pairs of closely related plant and animal taxa hybridize. Most of the avian hybrid zones in the Great Plains are characterized by strong divergence in molt and migration phenology, with eastern taxa molting before migrating each fall and western taxa migrating before molting. This stark difference in life history may manifest as disadvantageous phenotypic combinations in hybrid offspring, imposing strong post-zygotic reproductive isolation and maintaining the genetic integrity of parental taxa. I am currently integrating studies of captive birds, whole genomes, stable isotopes, and museum specimens to investigate how molt phenology divergence mediates introgression in these systems.

## Irruptive Fringillid movements

Perhaps no other animals epitomize the concept of facultative migration better than seed-eating birds that breed at high latitudes. When food supplies are sufficient year round, these species remain near their boreal and subarctic breeding areas throughout the winter. In years when seed crops fail however, entire populations may migrate hundreds of miles southward to winter in temperate latitudes. For my undergraduate honors thesis, I analyzed historic Christmas Bird Count and eBird records to explore spatiotemporal variation in the winter movements of high latitude breeding finch species. Together with [Dr. Herb Wilson](https://web.colby.edu/whwilson/), we demonstrated that northern finches invade southward in relatively even numbers across latitudes. We also found that temperate-breeding finches tend to migrate southward in the same years as their northern counterparts.
