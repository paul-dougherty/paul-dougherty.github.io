As an ornithologist, I am incredibly fortunate that my study organisms are both ubiquitous and charismatic. They present ample opportunities to connect with people and promote engagement with the natural world. 

Some of my recent outreach activities are listed below.

Since 2017, I have been a board member of the [Laramie Audubon Society](http://laramieaudubon.blogspot.com/), where I regularly lead birding trips and help to plan community events. I also compile and contribute to the organization's [newsletter](http://laramieaudubon.blogspot.com/p/newsletters.html).

I collaborated with other scientists and an artist to concieve and develop the [Art of Hybridization](https://www.wyomingnews.com/laramieboomerang/news/local_news/art-exhibit-explores-avian-hybridization/article_d671cf80-5b31-5bbd-a2e5-85b68a4a9da8.html), an art show that focuses on the avian hybrid zones of the Great Plains to explain evolution and the process of speciation. Through 2021, the show displayed at multiple lcations throughout Wyoming. The Art of Hybridization was funded through a Novel Outreach and Education Grant from the [UW Biodiviersity Institute](http://www.wyomingbiodiversity.org/).

My graduate research was featured in the August 2021 issue of [Birding Magazine](https://www.aba.org/birding-online-august-2021/).

I regularly assist with tours and other outreach events at the [University of Wyoming Museum of Vertebrates](https://www.uwymv.org/).
